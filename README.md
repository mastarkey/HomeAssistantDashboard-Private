## 🔧 Configuration

### Access Token

The dashboard uses a long-lived access token for authentication. Your token is already configured in the code:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIzMzMzYjM3ZWUyYjk0ODRmOWQ3ODk5ZGVhYzY4MTM4MCIsImlhdCI6MTc0OTg2MTU0MSwiZXhwIjoyMDY1MjIxNTQxfQ.juV15QOsu_jgW87tABrc7doVr97teA8jfihFDCWPDsw
```

### Home Assistant Configuration

The dashboard is configured in `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
lovelace:
  dashboards:
    react-dashboard:
      mode: yaml
      filename: dashboards/react-dashboard.yaml
      title: React Dashboard
      icon: mdi:react
      show_in_sidebar: true
      require_admin: false
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Starting the Dashboard

1. **Using the startup script**:
   ```bash
   /homeassistant/react-dashboard/start-dashboard.sh
   ```

2. **Or manually**:
   ```bash
   cd /homeassistant/react-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

### Accessing the Dashboard

- **From Home Assistant**: Click "React Dashboard" in the sidebar
- **Direct URL**: http://192.168.1.7:5173
- **Alternative**: http://homeassistant.local:5173

## 📦 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## 🏗️ Development

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
cd /homeassistant/react-dashboard
npm install
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Adding New Device Types

1. Create a new card component in `src/components/cards/`
2. Add the card to the switch statement in `EntityCard.tsx`
3. The card will automatically be used for that device type
4. Update `deviceRegistry.ts` to add device type detection logic

### Customizing Entity Filtering

Edit `src/utils/deviceFiltering.ts` to control which entities appear as primary devices.

## 🎨 UI Features

### Room View
- Automatically detects rooms from entity names
- Shows device count per room
- Click a room to see all devices in that room

### Category View
- Groups devices by type (Lights, Cameras, Climate, etc.)
- Shows count for each category
- Easy navigation between device types

### Smart Filtering
- Hides sub-entities (power sensors, battery levels, etc.)
- Only shows main hardware devices
- Related entities appear in device detail modals

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Single column layout
- **Tablet**: 2-3 columns
- **Desktop**: 4 columns
- **Large screens**: 5+ columns

## 🔌 WebSocket Connection

The dashboard connects to Home Assistant using:
- **URL**: Automatically detected (defaults to http://192.168.1.7:8123)
- **Protocol**: WebSocket with real-time updates
- **Authentication**: Long-lived access token
- **Auto-reconnect**: Yes (on connection loss)
- **Device Registry**: Fetches device information for enhanced identification
- **Area Registry**: Fetches area information for room mapping

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Feeds Not Showing
- The dashboard tries multiple URL strategies for camera feeds
- Check browser console for which URLs are being attempted
- Ensure your Home Assistant URL is accessible
- Use the refresh button to force reload stale feeds
- Enable auto-refresh for continuous updates (10-second intervals)

### Missing Devices
- Check the device filtering in `deviceFiltering.ts`
- Some entities might be filtered as sub-entities
- Look in the device modal for related entities

### Connection Issues
- Verify Home Assistant is accessible
- Check the access token is valid
- Ensure WebSocket port is not blocked
- Check browser console for connection errors

### Performance
- The dashboard deduplicates entities to improve performance
- Large numbers of entities are paginated
- Consider using room view to reduce visible entities

## 🔒 Security

- Uses long-lived access token for authentication
- Token is embedded in code (for convenience in local setup)
- For production, consider using environment variables
- All WebSocket communications are authenticated

## 🚧 Recent Updates

### Version 2.0 (Latest)
- ✅ **Room and Category Management**: Add/delete custom rooms and categories
- ✅ **Enhanced Device Assignment**: Move devices between rooms with visual interface
- ✅ **Climate Card Overhaul**: Quick mode controls, temperature history charts
- ✅ **Improved Add Device Modal**: Shows available Home Assistant devices by type
- ✅ **Room Normalization**: Fixed duplicate room issues (e.g., "dining room" vs "dining_room")
- ✅ **Edit Device Functionality**: Edit room assignments and device names
- ✅ **Hidden Rooms**: Hide empty rooms to declutter interface
- ✅ **Custom Device Support**: Add devices that don't exist in Home Assistant
- ✅ **Drag-and-Drop Everything**: Reorder rooms, categories, and devices

## 🚧 Roadmap

Future enhancements planned:
- [ ] Custom themes and color schemes
- [ ] Energy monitoring dashboard

- [ ] Voice control integration

## 🤝 Contributing

To extend this dashboard:
1. Follow the existing TypeScript patterns
2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Create reusable components
4. Add proper TypeScript types
5. Test with various entity types

## 📞 Support

For issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify Home Assistant is running
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check the Vite server logs
5. Review entity filtering if devices are missing
